Organising your work.

* Objectives
  - I should be able to differentiate between high/low priority tasks.
  - I should know what I will do every day: scheduled crons and other
    tasks on that day.
  - Do short term and long term planning wrt projects.
  - Get reminders.
  - Aggregate multiple channels of information in one location.

* Features
** 0.1
   - Create new tasks.
   - Tag each task with the project name.
   - Tag with category name: have to do, should do, and want to do.
   - Sub-tasks.
   - Define long term goals (3-months/1-year) with short-term deliverables.
   - End dates for tasks.
   - Possibly command line integration: add/modify tasks.

** 0.2
   - Handle multi-channels as descriptions for tasks: Gmail, Redmine,
     Google Calendar.
   - Automatic forwarding of schedules based on modification of end
    dates. Perhaps by maintaining an index of all dates, rather than
    defining one-one relationship between tasks.
   - Handle short-term things in the middle of long-term plans.
   - Add reminders on forgotten tasks.
